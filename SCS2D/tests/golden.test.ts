/**
 * Golden tests: the simulation's behaviour, pinned.
 *
 * The determinism tests prove the simulation is reproducible. These prove it
 * still does the *same thing* it did before — which is the check that makes it
 * safe to refactor the physics after months away. Run `npm test` from a cold
 * checkout: if these pass, the simulation is intact.
 *
 * WHEN ONE FAILS, that means simulated behaviour changed. Either:
 *
 *   - You did not mean to change it. Find out what you broke. Do not touch
 *     this file.
 *   - You did mean to change it. Say so in the commit message, run
 *     `npm run golden`, and paste the new constants in. Never copy a value out
 *     of a test failure without understanding what moved: doing that turns a
 *     regression into the new expected behaviour, permanently.
 *
 * Generated with: npm run golden
