# SpaceCombatSimulation
A Unity 3D project to simulate combat between space ships with vaguely realistic physics - Space ships are not aeroplanes!

Contribution:
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project,. I would prefer that any changes are put on a pull request for me before being merged onto master.

Controls (such as they are):
Z - make the ship cam follow a different object.
R - cycle reticle state

Filter and sort individuals in DB:
    runConfigId = 2 ORDER BY generation DESC, score DESC;

Limerick;
There once was a man from Toronto
Who needed a rhyming word pronto
He wanted to be 
In a limerick, see
So he named his daughter McGonto
